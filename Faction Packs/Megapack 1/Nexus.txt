[font=Verdana][size=6][center]Sim Settlements Faction Packs - Megapack 1 by Yagisan[/center][/size]
A variety of new factions to play as in Fallout 4.

This megapack contains both a basic faction pack, that only depends on Fallout 4 and all DLC, and an optional Directors Cut patch, that expands the factions with Mods and Creation Club content.
