[color=#8e7cc3][b]Yagisan's Standard Designer's Choice Mods[/b][/color]
Designer's Choice Mods are additional Sim Settlements plots that are used in most City Plans. To ensure the city plan looks as intended, you should have them installed.
Missing mods will result in random plots taking the place of chosen plots. This may result in settlements not matching their themes.
