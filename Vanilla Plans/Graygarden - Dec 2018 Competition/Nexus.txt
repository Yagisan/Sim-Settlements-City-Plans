Graygarden Horticultural Robotics is Yagisan's entry into the Dec 2018 City Plan design competition. Graygarden Horticultural Robotics is an automated farming community that produces corn, mutfruit, tatos, corn, razorgrain and some wild herbs. It also has a robot recycling and junk bot construction facilities, and a first class kitchen. It will eventually need to import water. Includes a small player home. Supports 15 settlers. Recommended to assign Supervisior White as mayor, and the robots to the 5 farms.

[color=#8e7cc3][b]Yagisan's Standard Designer's Choice Mods[/b][/color]
Designer's Choice Mods are additional Sim Settlements plots that are used in most City Plans. To ensure the city plan looks as intended, you should have them installed.
Missing mods will result in random plots taking the place of chosen plots. This may result in settlements not matching their themes.
